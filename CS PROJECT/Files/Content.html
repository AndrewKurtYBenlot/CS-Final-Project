		<h2>Why is poor healthcare in the Philippines a problem?</h2>
		<p>Poor healthcare has been a problem in the Philippines, especially in rural areas, because the quality of healthcare 
		in rural areas is significantly lower than at hospitals in big cities. Moreover, there is also a difference in the consistency 
		of private healthcare and facilities that are better equipped than public ones. Public healthcare and healthcare in rural 
		places are strained by the huge number of Filipinos who rely on them. Because of poverty, high medical expenses, and limited 
		access to care, health disparities persist.</p>
		
		<h2>What does "Health is Wealth" do to address this problem?</h2>
		<p>To address the problem of poor healthcare, our organization, Health is Wealth, aims to provide medical services that are 
		easily approachable and reasonably priced, including internet consultations, health education, and resources for preventive 
		care to underserved areas. This organization aims to provide equal medical quality in rural areas and public healthcare that 
		private healthcare in larger cities already has. To solve 1 SDG which is Good Health & Well-being, Health is Wealth is prepared 
		to make the medical world of the Philippines a better place.</p>
