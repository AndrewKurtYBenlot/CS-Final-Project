		<h2>Why is poor healthcare in the Philippines a problem?</h2>
		<p>Poor healthcare has been a problem in the Philippines especially in rural places because the quality of healthcare in rural areas 
		is of significantly lower quality than at hospitals in big cities. Moreover, there is also a difference in the consistencies of 
		private healthcare and facilities that are better equipped than public ones. Public healthcare and healthcare in rural places 
		strained from the huge number of Filipinos who rely on it. Because of poverty, high medical expenses, and limited access to care, 
		health disparities persist.</p>
		
		<h2>What does "Health is Wealth" do to address this problem?</h2>
		<p>In order to address the problem of poor healthcare, our organization, Health is Wealth, aims to provide  medical services that are easily approachable and reasonably priced, including internet consultations, health education,
		providing resources for preventive care to underserved areas. This organization aims to provide equal medical quality in rural areas and public healthcare that private healthcare in larger cities already
