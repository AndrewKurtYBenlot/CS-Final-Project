Explanation of how the quiz works:
  At first, the quiz will first provide all the data needed such as the questions, choices, and its correct answer. This may be done by providing the constant quizData with questions, choices and its answers in notepad++ or other coding applications. Next, as the user loads the quiz page, it will show the title of the quiz and the first question with choices. When the user picks the incorrect choice, the choice that the user picked will transition into a red color. But when the user picked the right choice, that choice will turn to a green color. The user may now proceed to the next page by clicking the Next button. After all the answers that the user picked, the user may click submit and the quiz would show the person's total score out of 5.
